Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>
